It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

Privacy of children
We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to Personal Information we may collect from children and take many special precautions to protect the privacy of children. We do not require any Personal Information from them at any time. We encourage children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any Web Application. We believe parents should be involved in the online activities of their children and suggest that parents do their best to provide their children with a safe and friendly online environment.

Links to other web applications
Our Web Application does not contain links to other mobile applications.

Information security
We do not collect any information.

Data breach
We do not collect any information. In the event we become aware that the security of the Web Application has been compromised as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. We will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of any breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice in the Web Application.

Changes and amendments
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When changes are made, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. Any updated version of this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Web Application or Services after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not collect Personal Data in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time you started using the Web Application. Policy was created with WebsitePolicies and edited accordingly to the characteristics of the Web Application.
